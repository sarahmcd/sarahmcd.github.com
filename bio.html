		<p class="title">Biography [Who is this fool?]</p>
		<p class="bio">Sarah McDaniel is both a true Granite Stater and a true child of the 90s.<br/>
		Born in the great state of New Hampshire in 1993, she began her undergraduate<br/> 
		studies at Tufts University in the fall of 2011. Sarah is currently pursuing<br/>
		English, French, and Computer Science as her academic concentrations; her<br/>
		particular intellectual interests lie in language, semantics, and literary theory.<br/>
		Her passion for education reform developed after her experience as a teacher<br/>
		intern at Breakthrough Manchester during the summer of 2012.<br/><br/>

		In her spare time, Sarah enjoys snowshoeing, long-distance running, dancing,<br/>
		and talking. She always welcomes discussion, collaboration, and conversation.<br/></p>
