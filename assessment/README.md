# COMP 20, Assignment 6: Security Analysis of Scorecenter

## IMPLEMENTED
I have created an HTML5 page called report.html that contains my security analysis of Garrett Friedman's Scorecenter web application. I have also created a CSS stylesheet and several other HTML5 pages displaying GitHub gists.

I have also made report.html accessible from my personal GitHub homepage, sarahmcd.github.com.

## COLLABORATION
I collaborated with Cameron Jackson and Jessie Serrino on this assignment. Cameron and I worked together to set up our reports and brainstorm potential security risks. Jessie and I collaborated in writing bash scripts and exploring database vulnerabilities with ridiculous POST requests.

## TIME SPENT
I spent approximately six hours completing this assignment.
